                <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry penne pasta</li>
                    <li>1 pound bacon, coarsely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 large onion <strong><em>Chopped</em></strong></li>
                    <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the pasta is cooking, cook bacon and onion in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until bacon is crisp and onion is beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain grease into a small container.</li>
                    <li>Drain pasta and transfer to a large serving bowl. Add oil and stir to coat pasta. Add cooked bacon and onion plus 1 to 2 tablespoons bacon grease. Sprinkle Parmesan over pasta and stir until well combined. Add more bacon grease as desired for flavor and moisture.</li>
                </ol>
