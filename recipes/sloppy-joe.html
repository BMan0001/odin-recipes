            <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>One of the easiest meat-forward suppers to throw together will always be sloppy joes. This sweet and savory meat sauce can be served in the traditional way inside a bun, or you can get inventive. Try it as a topper for a baked white or sweet potato, on top of rice or pasta, or even with polenta.</p>
